# Pharmacy-wholesale-KPI-summary
I created a KPI summary for a Pharma company based on their profits from 2010 to 2020, using data on Rx dosage types, distributor retail sales price, and wholesale sale price by order. The summary also included gross profits based on Rx route and Rx Dosage Type. The analysis revealed that the company's highest profits were in the 'Spray' category.

To visualize this data, I used Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that displayed the data in a clear and concise manner. The dashboard included charts, tables, and graphs that showed the company's profits over time, by product type, and by sales channel.

The first chart in the dashboard displayed the company's profits by Rx dosage types, distributor retail sales price, and wholesale sale price by order. This chart highlighted that the highest profits were generated by products in the 'Spray' category.

The second chart displayed the company's gross profits by Rx route and Rx Dosage Type. The chart showed that the highest gross profits were generated by products in the 'Spray' category and were sold through the 'Retail' sales channel.

Overall, the KPI summary and Tableau dashboard provided a comprehensive view of the company's profits and highlighted the significant contribution of the 'Spray' category to the company's overall profits. The visualizations allowed for easy analysis and identification of key trends and insights. The dashboard could be used by the company to make informed business decisions based on the data and insights presented.
